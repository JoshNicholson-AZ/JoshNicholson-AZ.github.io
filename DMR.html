            A friend of mine, Alonzo O'Leary, that I serve with in the military wanted to start a podcast as he prepares
            for a Masters in
            Film. Once the podcast began, we decided that having a website would build credibility and be an excellent
            outlet for gaining new listeners.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>This was my first website and the idea of creating, hosting, and maintaining a website
                was overwhelming.</b> I took it slow and purchased a domain name, then a hosting platform, and from
            there I started
            understanding WordPress. In my evenings after work when I would browse WordPress,
            I was able to learn the layouts, main themes and how to interact with those, how to build
            pages, and change content.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><a href="https://drunkmovierants.com/">Click here to visit -Drunk Movie Rants- WordPress website</a>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            What I found very interesting were the plugins which added a wealth of creative options.
            I installed plugins that helped me build a newsletter, add security to the site, podcast subsribe buttons,
            and track stats. The plugin that proved most useful was Elementor. It gave me a wide amount of options to
            create themes and design the layout of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            My next challenge was figuring out how to create a media player to play each episode on the website. The
            <b><a href="https://castos.com/">Seriously Simple
                    Podcast</a></b> plugin with a widget built into the Elementor template was the perfect tool. It
            allowed me
            to drag and drop
            the media player into the template and upload a sidebar picture, change colors, style, etc. and <b>it works
                in both desktop
                and mobile formats through the web browser. As a newcomer to web developing, this was just exciting!
            </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            As more of the episodes kept flowing in and the podcast evovled, we decided that having an outtakes section
            would be a great way to add content for listeners. I decided that we needed a new subpage that would host
            the
            outtakes and I added one to the header. A problem I had to figure out was -- <b>how do I filter the podast
                episode feed within WordPress?</b>
            I was getting outtakes in the episodes only feed. I spent hours looking into tags, filters, podcast feeds,
            forums on the Elementor website, etc.
            Eventually, I understood that I could label each podcast page with a specific TAG. I created one for
            EPISODES
            and another for OUTTAKES.
            Once that was set up, I realized that within the elementor feed under POST QUERY there were EXCLUDE
            CATERGORIES that were linked to the tags
            I created for each page. <b>By excluding certain tags within the post query, I removed the content I didn't
                want on specific feeds!</b>
        </p>
        <img src="DMRepisodes.JPG" alt="">
        <p>
            We also built an Instagram page and I researched an option to install a plugin that would add a social media
            widget
            within Elementor. I found <a href="https://rebelcode.com/">REBELCODE</a> and all I had to do was link my
            Instgram credentials
            to the plugin and from there edit and adjust the widget to fit our home page. <b>The results and performance
                are outstanding
                and it is just a testament to how powerful solid code can make our projects.</b>
        </p>

            Being my first WordPress site, I was surprised at the simplicity of the
            platform
            and how easy it was to update in real time and connect with a hosting website. WordPress appealed to me
            initially because
            25%+ of sites on the web use it as their platform of choice and it is intuitivie for beginners. As I
            continue to work on the site, I am having a difficult time
            adpating the site to be compatible with desktop and mobile versions. The difficulty is identifying where the
            problem is coming from
            and if I'll be able to fix it because I don't have full control over the plugins or platform. The
            more I continue to study HTML, CSS,
            and Javascript, the more I realize how limited WordPress can be and how you have to redevelop WordPress when
            it could
            just be easier to build a site from scratch and retain full control over each layer of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>All shortcomings and progress aside, this has been a very rewarding project and I'll continue to upgrade
                the
                podcast
                site as I learn more and look forward to maintaining it for years to come.</b>
